***Scene Perception and Event Cognition Theory (SPECT)*. When we experience visual narratives (comics, TV shows, Movies) there is a coordination of visual perception, attention, and comprehension processes.  Studies testing SPECT explore how processes such as inference generation affect where we look when we watch filmed narratives or read static sequential narratives.**

    <summary style="font-size:2rem"><b>Understanding what factors affect adults success understanding and using media</b></summary>

**What makes college readers more or less ready to read in college?  We explore answers to this this question in a project that was funded by the [Institute of Education Sciences](https://ies.ed.gov/).  Across several studies, we explored how foundational skills of reading, reading strategies, task awareness, and motivation support college student’s ability to successfully use texts to solve the kinds of reading activities that they are asked to do in their college coursework.**

    <summary style="font-size:2rem"><b>Using construct response to learn about readers</b></summary>

**We explore how to use student constructed responses that are produced during reading to help learn about what is involved in making sense of texts and what makes readers more or less successful at comprehending what they read.  One type of constructed response is called a “think aloud” response in which readers are asked to produce whatever thoughts they have when they read. Another type of constructed response occurs when readers are told to self explain the text as they read.  Member of the Media Comprehension Lab are part of a collaborative nextwork including Laura Allen (University of Minnesota), Danielle McNamara (Arizona State University), and Katie McCarthy (Georgia State University) to develop ways to get computers to collect and analyze student constructed responses. This research was funded by the [Institute of Education Sciences](https://ies.ed.gov/).**
